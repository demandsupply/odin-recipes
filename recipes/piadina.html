        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Piadina is an Italian flatbread, a no-yeast soft dough made only with flour, water and extra virgin olive oil or lard. 
            Just few ingredients to make a delicious bread for all of your favourite sandwiches.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500 g (3 ¾ cups) of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>220 ml (1 cup) of water at room temperature</li>
            <li>80 ml (about ⅓ cup) of extra virgin olive oil or 80 g (about ⅓ cup) of lard</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of fine salt</li>
            <li>⅓ teaspoon of baking soda</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First place the flour in a bowl with the baking soda and salt. Mix well. Then add the oil or, if you prefer, the softened lard. We used extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li>Now add the water at room temperature. Mix everything for a few minutes until you get a soft but compact dough. If the dough sticks to your fingers, add a sprinkling 
                of flour again. Piadina dough must be soft but not sticky.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with cling film and let it rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Then divide the dough into 6 portions of about 100/110 g each (3.5/3.8 0z).</li>
            <li>Work them a little with your hand on the work surface in order to have balls with a smooth surface and let them rest for another 10 minutes covered with a kitchen towel.

                Roll out each ball with the help of a rolling pin, forming a disc with a thickness of 4/5 mm (about 0,20 inch) and a diameter of about 20/25 cm (8/10 inch).</li>
            <li>Don’t worry if they don’t turn out perfectly round. Imperfection means “handmade” and no one will think you bought them! Now you have to cook them. But first an IMPORTANT TIP: while cooking a Piadina, 
                keep the other raw Piadina covered with a cloth. This is to prevent the dough from drying out. (See more in the paragraph: “How to Make Best Piadina Bread: Cooking Tips”).</li>
            <li>So now cook the Piadina one at a time in a preheated non-stick pan. Turn the Piadina after a minute or when bubbles form. Repeat it twice, pricking it here and there with a fork. The piadina must cook 
                about 2 minutes per side (4 minutes in total). Piadina is ready when it has taken on a slightly golden color and the characteristic small dark spots have appeared on the surface.</li>
            <li>Your homemade Piadina is ready to be stuffed. Arrange them one on top of the other covered with a cloth that will help keep them warm. Bring them to the table stuffed as you like 
                with what you prefer! Piadina is fantastic with everything, even on its own!</li>
